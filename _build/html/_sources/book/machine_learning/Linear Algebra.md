# Linear Algebra

```
Linear Algebra is an important topic to understand, a lot of deep learning algorithms use it, so this chapter will teach the topics needed to understand what will come next.

## Scalars, Vectors and Matrices
- Scalars: A single number
- Vector: A 1D array of numbers, where each element is identified by an single index
- Matrix: A 2D array of numbers, below we have a (2-row)X(3-col) matrix. In matrices a single element is identified by two indexes instead of one.

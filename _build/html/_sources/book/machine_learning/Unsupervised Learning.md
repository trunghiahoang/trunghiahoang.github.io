# Unsupervised Learning
```{tableofcontents}
```
As mentioned on previous chapters, unsupervised learning is about learning information without the label information.
Here the term information means, "structure" for instance you would like to know how many groups exist in your dataset, even if you don't know what those groups mean.
Also we use unsupervised learning to visualize your dataset, in order to try to learn some insight from the data.

# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that learn to represent the data. Below we list the most popular ones.

- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Deep Belief Networks
- Deep Auto-Encoders
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM/GRU)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

One of the promises of deep learning is that they will substitute hand-crafted feature extraction. The idea is that they will "learn" the best features needed to represent the given data.

# Approximation
An approximation is anything that is intentionally similar but not exactly equal to something else.

## In Mathematics

Approximation theory is a branch of mathematics, a quantitative part of functional analysis. Diophantine approximation deals with approximations of real numbers by rational numbers.

Approximation usually occurs when an exact form or an exact numerical number is unknown or difficult to obtain. However some known form may exist and may be able to represent the real form so that no significant deviation can be found. For example, 1.5 × 106 means that the approximation 1,500,000 has been measured to the nearest hundred thousand (the actual value is somewhere between 1,450,000 and 1,550,000), this is in contrast to the notation 1.500 × 106 which measures 1,500,000 to the nearest thousand (therefore giving a true value somewhere between 1,499,500 and 1,500,500).

It also is used when a number is not rational, such as the number π, which often is shortened to 3.14159, or 1.414 as the shortened form of √2.

Numerical approximations sometimes result from using a small number of significant digits. Calculations are likely to involve rounding errors and other approximation errors. Log tables, slide rules and calculators produce approximate answers to all but the simplest calculations. The results of computer calculations are normally an approximation expressed in a limited number of significant digits, although they can be programmed to produce more precise results.[3] Approximation can occur when a decimal number cannot be expressed in a finite number of binary digits.

Related to approximation of functions is the asymptotic value of a function, i.e. the value as one or more of a function's parameters becomes arbitrarily large. For example, the sum (k/2)+(k/4)+(k/8)+...(k/2^n) is asymptotically equal to k. No consistent notation is used throughout mathematics and some texts use ≈ to mean approximately equal and ~ to mean asymptotically equal whereas other texts use the symbols the other way around.

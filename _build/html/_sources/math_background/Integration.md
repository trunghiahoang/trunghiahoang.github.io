# Integration

In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operations of calculus,[a] the other being differentiation. Integration started as a method to solve problems in mathematics and physics.
in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity

A definite integral of a function can be represented as the signed area of the region bounded by its graph and the horizontal axis. In the above graph as an example, the integral of f(x) is the blue (+) area subtracted by the yellow (-) area.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Checklist: A Case Study

In this section we will run through an informal “checklist” of things to do when embarking on an exploratory data analysis. As a running example I will use a dataset on hourly ozone levels in the United States for the year 2014. The elements of the checklist are

 1. Formulate your question
        	    
 2. Read in your data
            	    
 3.  Check the packaging
            	    
 4.  Look at the top and the bottom of your data
            	    
 5.  Check your “n”s
            	    
 6.  Validate with at least one external data source
            	    
 7.  Make a plot
            	    
 8.  Try the easy solution first
            	    
 9.  Follow up

Overview
The course is a brief overview of the basic tools from Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus that will be needed in subsequent courses of the program.
Key Outcomes
By completing the course the students will have been reminded of the basic tools of Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus needed in subsequent courses in the program, notably:
 Fundamental properties of matrices, their norms, and their applications
 Differentiating/integrating multiple variable functions, and the role of the gradient and the
hessian matrix.
 Basic properties of optimization problems involving matrices and functions of multiple variables.
Requirements and Prerequisites
This course is meant to be a refresher. Students are assumed to have developed some mathematical maturity through a few mathematically oriented classes that involve the standard undergraduate treatment of linear algebra and single‐variable calculus.

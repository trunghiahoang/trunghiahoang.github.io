# Supervised Learning
```{tableofcontents}
```
In this chapter we will learn about Supervised learning as well as talk a bit about Cost Functions and Gradient descent. Also we will learn about 2 simple algorithms:
Linear Regression (for Regression)
Logistic Regression (for Classification)
The first thing to learn about supervised learning is that every sample data point x has an expected output or label y, in other words your training is composed of pairs.

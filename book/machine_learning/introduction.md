# Machine Learning

Machine learning is all about using your computer to "learn" how to deal with
problems without “programming". (It’s a branch of artificial intelligence)
We take some data, train a model on that data, and use the trained model to
make predictions on new data. Basically is a way to make the computer create a
program that gives some output with a known input and that latter give a intelligent
output to a different but similar input.
We need machine learning on cases that would be difficult to program by hand all
possible variants of a classification/prediction problem
The basic Idea of Machine Learning is to make the computer learn something from the data. Machine learning comes in two flavors:
- Supervised Learning: You give to the computer some pairs of inputs/outputs, so in the future new when new inputs are presented you have an intelligent output.
- Unsupervised Learning: You let the computer learn from the data itself without showing what is the expected output.

# Examples of Supervised Learning

- Image Classification: Your train with images/labels. Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognise the new object (Classification)
- Market Prediction: You train the computer with historical market data and ask the computer to predict the new price in the future (Regression)

# Welcome To My Data Science Blogs

Hello `everybody`, my name is `Huynh Trung Nghia`.
I am a `data scientist` working in `Ho Chi Minh City`, `Vietnam`.

I write this blog with the desire to share my knowledge and my experience so that I can help beginners access the most basic knowledge and have an overview of `data science`.

`Note`: The knowledge contained herein is gathered from my work experience and may not be consistent in some cases.

Throughout this blog I will share the most basic and necessary knowledge for you to learn DS.
It will include knowledge of math, examples code along with some real projects.
